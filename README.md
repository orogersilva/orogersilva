**I solve problems coding mobile software. As a Senior Android Developer, this GitHub is focused, mainly, in Android source code.** 

**I'm a heavy practitioner of Extreme Programming. "INDIVIDUALS AND INTERACTIONS over processes and tools" - I strongly believe in that and I am also interessed in other Agile topics.**

* 👨‍💻 I am working at [Aubay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aubay-portugal/), as a Senior Android Developer in Lisbon, Portugal.
* ✍ I wrote a [book](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-entrega-continua-android) about Continuous Delivery (CD) for Android Development context.
* 🎤 I have [presentations](https://speakerdeck.com/orogersilva) that I did in past conferences and throughout short talks.
